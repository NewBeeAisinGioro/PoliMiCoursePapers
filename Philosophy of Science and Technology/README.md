# Philosophy of Science and Technology<br></br>
### Papers for this course are quite easy to write. I got 28/30L for this course finally.<br></br>
The topics of the assigned essays are described here below:

**PAPER 1**

The philosophical problem of demarcation between science and pseudo-science is closely related to the issues of scientific method and scientific progress. Explain in detail why that is the case. Then, describe the different solutions to the demarcation problem proposed by Inductivism, Falsificationism, Kuhn, Lakatos and Feyerabend, emphasizing merits and limitations of each of them. Finally, present your favorite view on the matter and illustrate it by applying to concrete cases (e.g. climate science, vaccination, creationism, etc.)

**PAPER 2**

The problem of space is an outstanding topic in philosophy of science. Explain what are the metaphysical, epistemological and physical questions that arise in its context. Discuss in detail the debate between substantivalism and relationism, by outlining the position of Newton, Leibniz and Mach: in particular, review the various arguments in favor and against the two conceptions of space. Finally, present your own view on the matter.

**PAPER 3**

Explain why scientific practice goes (and sometimes needs to go) beyond the traditional trichotomy of theories, observations, and experiments in such a way to employ different tools: from tools of thought like thought experiments all the way to technological tools like computer simulations. Choose one of these tools and present the main philosophical issues at stake. Describe two philosophical approaches that promise to tackle such issues. Defend your favorite one and criticize the other, by referring to concrete case studies taken from any scientific field.  

**CLASS PRESENTATION (or alternative paper: 2000 words)**

Choose a case-study, possibly related to your own research, and discuss it within the context of either one of these topics: Bayesianism, New Experimentalism, Scientific Laws, and Realism\Anti-realism.
